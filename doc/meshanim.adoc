[small]#Returns the list of keys (or, more precisely, of  
link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame++[key frames]).
Each entry of the list is a table having the following fields:
_list[i].time_ (a number denoting time) and
_list[i].value_ (an index into the <<mesh, mesh>>'s list of <<animmesh, anim meshes>>).#

NOTE: (In my understanding) the <<meshanim.mesh_name, mesh_name>> should allow to identify
one or more <<mesh, _meshes_>> to be animated with this set of keys. Each of these meshes
should then have, in its own list of <<animmesh, anim meshes>>, the data for its animation
at the indices contained in the keys returned by <<meshanim.keys, meshanim:keys>>( ).
