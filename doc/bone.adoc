[[bone.num_weights]]
* *bone:num_weights* ( ) +
-> _n_

* *bone:weights* ( ) +
-> _t_ +
[small]#Returns a (possibly sparse) array _t_, where _t[v]_ is the weight of the vertex
indexed by _v_ in the <<mesh, _mesh_>>'s list of vertices (_t[v]_=_nil_ if the vertex 
is not part of the bone).#

* *bone:ordered_weights* ( ) +
-> _t_ +
[small]#Returns an array _t_ of <<bone.num_weights, num_weights>> tables, each having two elements: 
_t[i].vertex_ and _t[i].weight_, denoting the index of a vertex and its weight, respectively.
The vertices are in the same order as in the underlying aiBone structure#

* *bone:offset_matrix* ( ) +
-> _a~11~_, _a~12~_, _..._, _a~44~_ +
[small]#Returns the elements of the offset matrix, in row-major order.#
