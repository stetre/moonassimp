* _name_ = _bone_++:++*name*( )

[[bone.num_weights]]
* _n_ = _bone_++:++*num_weights*( )

* _t_ = _bone_++:++*weights*( ) +
[small]#Returns a table _t_, where _t[i]_ is the weight of the _i_-th vertex (its 1-based index
in the <<mesh, _mesh_>>'s list of vertices), or _nil_ if the vertex is not part of the bone. +
(Note that the returned table is likely to contain holes, so do not iterate with ipairs().)#

* _t_ = _bone_++:++*ordered_weights*( ) +
[small]#Returns an array _t_ of <<bone.num_weights, num_weights>>(&nbsp;) tables, 
each having two elements: 
_t[i].vertex_ and _t[i].weight_, denoting respectively the 1-based index of a vertex and its weight. 
The vertices are in the same order as in the underlying aiBone structure#

* _a~11~_, _a~12~_, _..._, _a~44~_ = _bone_++:++*offset_matrix*( ) +
[small]#Returns the elements of the offset matrix, in row-major order.#
